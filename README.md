# odin-recipes

Working my way through The Odin Project. Already have learned HTML CSS and JS but am putting everything together with TOP.

This is a simple recipe site with 3 linked pages(recipes).

skills fortified: 
-git: init, clone, add, commit, status, log, push origin main
-habit of committing early and often
-linking images with correct file path
-file structure/organization


ADDING CSS -->  purely for practice and not trying to make anything look pretty

--------------------------------------------
UPDATE 2/23
removing most of the css styles since they were ugly and the project doesn't require it. moving on to pick up where I left off 2 years ago.
